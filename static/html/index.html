    What is Pomelo?
</h2>
<p>
    Discord is likely to remove the current Username#Tag system.<br>
    Instead of it we are likely going to get a similar system to Twitter with @Usernames and Display names.<br>
    This will not allow duplicate @Usernames but will allow duplicate Display names.<br>
    The API to check if a Username is valid or taken has already been exposed.<br>
    This website is a simple tool to check if a Username is valid or taken.<br>
